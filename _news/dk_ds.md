**Data Science Engineer @ DraftKings**  
A "Data Science Engineer" is a Data Scientist + Machine Learning Engineer.  
I worked on the Risk & Fraud team. The job was truly full-stack: formulating business cases, creating data pipelines, developing machine learning models, deploying them to production, setting up monitors, and responding to errors. Two projects I was particularly focused on were quantifying the skill of a bettor and catching identity fraud during a registration attempt.
