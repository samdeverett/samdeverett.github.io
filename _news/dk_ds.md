**Data Science Engineer @ [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com)**  
A "Data Science Engineer" is a Data Scientist + Machine Learning Engineer.  
I worked on the Risk & Fraud team. The job was full-stack: formulating business cases, creating data pipelines, developing machine learning models, deploying them to production, setting up monitors, and responding to errors. The two projects I worked most on were quantifying the skill of a bettor and catching identity fraud during a registration attempt.
