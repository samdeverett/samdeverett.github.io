**Data Science Engineer @ DraftKings**
A "Data Science Engineer" is a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer.
I worked on the Risk & Fraud team. The work was full-stack: formulating business cases, creating data pipelines, developing machine learning models, deploying them to production, setting up monitors, and responding to errors. Two projects I was particularly focused on were quantifying the skill of a bettor and catching identity fraud during a registration attempt.
