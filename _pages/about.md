Welcome to my personal page! ðŸ˜€

I am a Data Science Engineer (think: Data Scientist meets Machine Learning Engineer) at DraftKings. I work in the Risk & Fraud space, where I spend most of my time developing models for quantifying the skill of a bettor.

I am also a Research Assistant in the [Frankel Lab at MIT](http://fraenkel.mit.edu). The project I'm focused on is fine-tuning a large language model for metabolomics research.

I hope to become more involved in the AI Safety and Alignment space. While I believe technology has the power to radically improve our well-being, I am equally wary of its potential to further the spread of misinformation, ideological polarization, mental health crises from unrealistic expectations, mass surveillance, autonomous weapons, and even catastrophic superintelligence.

I am actively looking for opportunities to engage in DS/AI/ML work focused on understanding and combating the issues listed above. I'm also seeking hands-on experiences for advancing my software engineering, deep learning, and statistics skill sets. If you know of any such opportunities or have an idea you'd like to collaborate on, I would love to connect. I am also happy to chat about anything else :)
